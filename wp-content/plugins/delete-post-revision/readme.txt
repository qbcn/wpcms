Help you clean out redundant & repetitive post revisions and thin out the database.

== Description ==

Post revisions are backups of articles editors are writing and forgot to hit save. They are also article versions stored in the WP database, as a way to see how the post's content evolved.

While they are important for this later reason, sometimes WordPress creates post revisions with minimal changes to the post content. These are "redundant" post revisions and they do nothing more but slow down page loading time and bulk up the database with useless content.

This WordPress plugin can help webmasters delete these kind of redundant posts.
